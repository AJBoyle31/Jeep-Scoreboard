# Jeep-Scoreboard

For the Jeep Wave article. A user goes through 10 sections and fills out a form based on their Jeep. At the end of the form, it tells the user what their score is, what category they fall in, a picture for that category, and an option to tweet the result. 

The background colors and logo at the top are just temporary for the initial creation. This will be most likely edited out so that this scoring system can be incorporated with the Jeep Wave article.
